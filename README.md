# ðŸ¤° Pregnancy Risk Assistant â€“ A Proactive RAG Chatbot for Maternal Risk Assessment

An intelligent AI assistant that proactively engages pregnant women, assesses their symptoms, and gives risk-based guidance using advanced language models and medical knowledge.

---

## Overview

Pregnancy is a sensitive and critical period where early identification of potential risks can save lives. The Pregnancy Risk Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot designed to support pregnant women by:

- Proactively asking key symptom-related questions
- Retrieving medically relevant information using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Providing color-coded risk levels (Low, Medium, High) with suggested actions
- Maintaining a conversational, empathetic, and helpful tone

## How the Chatbot Works â€“ Step by Step

### 1. User Interaction Begins
- The chatbot automatically starts the conversation using Streamlit
- It asks 4 key health-related questions (bleeding, baby movement, headaches, other symptoms)
- Each question is asked one-by-one in a friendly and simple interface

### 2. Query Construction
- The user's responses are collected into a full query like:  
  "Assess pregnancy risk based on: I have slight bleeding; My baby is not moving today..."

### 3. Retrieval with LlamaIndex (RAG)
- LlamaIndex searches for relevant information from indexed documents:
  - risk_knowledge.txt
  - GraviLog_Pregnancy_Risk.pdf
  - PregnancyToDoChecklist.pdf
  - Pregnancy_Planner_508.pdf

### 4. Gemini Generates the Response
- The query and retrieved medical content are sent to Gemini 1.5 Flash
- The model responds with a detailed answer (e.g., concern for preeclampsia)

### 5. Risk Classification
- Custom logic detects keywords and categorizes the risk as:
  - Low
  - Medium
  - High
- Example:
  - "blurry vision", "swelling", and "no fetal movement" â†’ High Risk

### 6. Output to User
- The app displays:
  - User's responses
  - Gemini's AI advice
  - Risk level with emojis and colors
  - A clear call-to-action

## ðŸ§ª Sample Query and Output

**User Responses:**
- I have unusual discharge.
- My baby hasnâ€™t moved much today.
- Iâ€™ve had a strong headache and blurred vision.

**AI Output:**
> The symptoms youâ€™ve described â€” vaginal discharge, decreased fetal movement, and blurry vision â€” raise concern for a high-risk condition such as **preeclampsia or fetal distress**. Immediate evaluation by an obstetrician is recommended.

**Risk Level:** ðŸš¨ High  
**Suggested Action:** Visit ER or OB emergency department immediately.
